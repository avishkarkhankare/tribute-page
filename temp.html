    <h1>Swami Vivekananda</h1>

    <div style="width:1050px; text-align: justify; height:545px;">Swami Vivekananda was a Hindu monk and one of the most
        celebrated spiritual leaders of India. He was more than just a spiritual mind; he was a prolific thinker, great
        orator and passionate patriot. He carried on the free-thinking philosophy of his guru, Ramakrishna Paramhansa
        forward into a new paradigm. He worked tirelessly towards betterment of the society, in servitude of the poor
        and needy, dedicating his all for his country. He was responsible for the revival of Hindu spiritualism and
        established Hinduism as a revered religion on world stage. His message of universal brotherhood and
        self-awakening remains relevant especially in the current backdrop of widespread political turmoil around the
        world. The young monk and his teachings have been an inspiration to many, and his words have become goals of
        self-improvement especially for the youth of the country. For this very reason, his birthday, January 12, is
        celebrated as the National Youth Day in India.

        <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>

        Born Narendranath Dutta, into an affluent Bengali family in Calcutta, Vivekananda was one of the eight children
        of Vishwanath Dutta and Bhuvaneshwari Devi. He was born on January 12, 1863, on the occasion of Makar Sankranti.
        Father Vishwanath was a successful attorney with considerable influence in society. Narendranath’s mother
        Bhuvaneshwari was a woman endowed with a strong, God-fearing mind who had a great impact on her son.

        As a young boy, Narendranath displayed sharp intellect. His mischievous nature belied his interest in music,
        both instrumental as well as vocal. He excelled in his studies as well, first at the Metropolitan institution,
        and later at the Presidency College in Calcutta. By the time he graduated from the college, he had acquired a
        vast knowledge of different subjects. He was active in sports, gymnastics, wrestling and body building. He was
        an avid reader and read up on almost everything under the sun. He perused the Hindu scriptures like the Bhagvad
        Gita and the Upanishads on one hand, while on the other hand he studied western philosophy, history and
        spirituality by David Hume, Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Herbert Spencer.

       <h2>Lecture at the World Parliament of Religions</h2> 

        During the course of his wanderings, he came to know about the World Parliament of Religions being held in
        Chicago, America in 1893. He was keen to attend the meeting, to represent India, Hinduism and his Guru Sri
        Ramakrishna’s philosophies. He found assertion of his wishes while he was meditating on the rocks of
        Kanyakumari, the southernmost tip of India. Money was raised by his disciples in Madras (now Chennai) and Ajit
        Singh, Raja of Khetri, and Vivekananda left for Chicago on May 31, 1893 from Bombay.

        He faced insurmountable hardships on his way to Chicago, but his spirits remained as indomitable as ever. On 11
        September 1893, when the time came, he took the stage and stunned everyone with his opening line “My brothers
        and sisters of America”. He received a standing ovation from the audience for the opening phrase. He went on to
        describe the principles of Vedanta and their spiritual significance, putting Hinduism on the map of World
        Religions.

        He spent the next two and a half years in America and founded the Vedanta Society of New York in 1894. He also
        travelled to the United Kingdom to preach the tenets of the Vedanta and Hindu Spiritualism to the western world.
